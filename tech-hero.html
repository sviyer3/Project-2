    <h2>Who He Is</h2>
    <p>
        	The rise of climate change has brought widescale insecurities in terms of infrastructure, resources, and general physical devastation. Recently, hurricanes have been pummeling the eastern coast of the United States and the Caribbean. We can remember recent storms like hurricane Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey wrecking the infrastructure of the local areas and causing mass flooding. Through these events, however, there have been smaller glimmers of hope. Moses West, a veteran and a visionary, has provided unique solutions to tackle the aforementioned problems by providing access to clean drinking water through his efforts in the United States and the Caribbean.

	For this reason, we have selected Moses West to be our tech hero, who is an inspiration for his capability to increase access to clean water through technological solutions. During hurricane Melissa which pummeled Jamaica in 2025, Moses West’s solar technology kept water flowing through the event. Even as the category 5 hurricane pummeled local power grids, Moses West’s Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG), kept running. His invention is unique and one of a kind, never seen before, drawing water from the air and turning the water into clean drinkable water. In one related interview, Moses West’s AWG is seen to turn plastic diesel into clean drinkable water showing the key innovation that exists with the machine. Furthermore, Moses West’s invention is practical aiding in real-time solutions that help low-income people across the globe.

	Moses West’s brilliance continues with his founding of the Moses West Foundation which states that the access to clean water is human right. Regardless of political affiliations or one’s individual stances on different sociological positions, we can all agree that the access to clean water is key to rebuilding communities and creating a better world. Furthermore, we find that Moses West’s contributions are not only charitable, but very innovative, his innovations finding their way into affected communities across the globe.
	
	To be great, is to be conscientious of the world you live in and the contributions that you give. Moses West highlights this with his ability to provide access to clean drinking water regardless of tropical storms that may be pelting the local populace. His efforts are noble and one of a kind continuing to inspire others across the globe.
