					<h3>Moses West</h3>
					<p class="hero-role">Innovator</p>
				
				<p>
				The rise of climate change has brought widescale insecurities in terms of infrastructure, resources, and general physical devastation. Recently, hurricanes have been pummeling the eastern coast of the United States and the Caribbean. We can remember recent storms like hurricane Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey wrecking the infrastructure of the local areas and causing mass flooding. Through these events, however, there have been smaller glimmers of hope. Moses West, a veteran and a visionary, has provided unique solutions to tackle the aforementioned problems by providing access to clean drinking water through his efforts in the United States and the Caribbean.

				For this reason, we have selected Moses West to be our tech hero, who is an inspiration for his capability to increase access to clean water through technological solutions. During hurricane Melissa which pummeled Jamaica in 2025, Moses West’s solar technology kept water flowing through the event. Even as the category 5 hurricane pummeled local power grids, Moses West’s Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG), kept running. His invention is unique and one of a kind, never seen before, drawing water from the air and turning the water into clean drinkable water. In one related interview, Moses West’s AWG is seen to turn plastic diesel into clean drinkable water showing the key innovation that exists with the machine. Furthermore, Moses West’s invention is practical aiding in real-time solutions that help low-income people across the globe.

				Moses West’s brilliance continues with his founding of the Moses West Foundation which states that the access to clean water is human right. Regardless of political affiliations or one’s individual stances on different sociological positions, we can all agree that the access to clean water is key to rebuilding communities and creating a better world. Furthermore, we find that Moses West’s contributions are not only charitable, but very innovative, his innovations finding their way into affected communities across the globe.
	
				To be great, is to be conscientious of the world you live in and the contributions that you give. Moses West highlights this with his ability to provide access to clean drinking water regardless of tropical storms that may be pelting the local populace. His efforts are noble and one of a kind continuing to inspire others across the globe.

					<h3>Kizzmekia Corbett</h3>
					<p class="hero-role">Immunologist</p>
				
				<p>
				  Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett is an American immunologist whose work has played a pivotal role in developing one of the first effective COVID-19 vaccines. She is a viral immunologist at the National Institutes of Health, and has led key research on the structure
				  and immune response to SARS-CoV-2, contributing foundational knowledge that has directly supported the Moderna vaccine design. Her work focuses on how the human immune system recognizes and responds to viruses, particularly coronavirus. In 2020, as COVID-19 
				  spread globally, her team mapped the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the key structure the virus uses to enter human cells, and determined how to instruct the immune system to generate a strong protective response. This research formed the scientific backbone for
				  for the messenger RNA vaccines, which teach cells to produce harmless pieces of the virus so that immunity can develop without infection. Her contributions were also communicative: Corbett became a public voice explaining vaccine science to diverse audiences, 
				  emphasizing equity, accessibility, and trust in medical technology. She has spoken about the importance of representation in science and the need for communities that have been historically underrepresented in research to have confidence in medical advances. 
				  Her outreach, especially in Black and Latinx communities has highlighted ethical and cultural dimensions of vaccine acceptance. Beyond COVID-19, Corbett's work continues to influence the broader field of immunology and vaccine design. She has published many peer
				  reviewed articles on immune response, viral structure, and vaccine strategy. She also continues her research on the next generation vaccines for emerging pathogens.

                    <h3>Fei-Fei Li</h3>
                    <p class="hero-role">Computer Scientist</p>

                    <p>
                        Fei-Fei Li is a computer scientist whose work helped shape modern computer vision, especially
                        through ImageNet, a large dataset that made it possible to train and evaluate image-recognition
                        systems at a much bigger scale. ImageNet became a turning point because it pushed researchers to
                        measure performance more clearly and compare models in a shared way, which accelerated progress in AI.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What makes her a strong “tech hero” for this class is that she also speaks publicly about the social
                        impact of AI. She has argued that technology is not just about building more powerful tools — it also
                        matters who benefits, who is harmed, and what values are built into the system. In other words, her work
                        connects technical innovation with responsibility, which fits our course focus on bias, equity, and power.
