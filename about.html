            <!-- Who I Am -->
            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <p>
                I am a student interested in the intersection of technology, identity, and social equity.
                My background has shaped how I see access to education, opportunity, and digital spaces.

            <!-- Academic Interests -->
            <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
            <p>
                I am particularly interested in how technology influences systems of power, including
                algorithmic bias, digital divides, and representation in tech industries.
            </p>

            <!-- Goals -->
            <h4>My Goals</h4>
            <p>
                I hope to contribute to building more inclusive digital spaces and work toward equity in
                tech education and workforce development.

            <!-- Who I Am -->
            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <p>
                Hi everyone, my name is Jassi. I am a senior studying Information Science. I was a Computer
                Science major before, so I have some experience in coding, especially front end.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I love watching movies, playing video games, and hanging out with my cat Biscuit.
            </p>

            <!-- Academic Interests -->
            <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
            <p>
                I’m interested in how people interact with technology and how design choices can shape what
                users notice, trust, or misunderstand. I also like learning about front-end development and
                building interfaces that feel clear and easy to use.
            </p>

            <!-- Goals -->
            <h4>My Goals</h4>
            <p>
                I’m excited to take this course because it connects areas I haven’t explored much before, and I
                want to better understand how technology and society affect each other.

            <!-- Who I Am -->
            <h4>Who I Am</h4>
            <p>
                Hi everyone. My name is Yilin Gao. I’m a senior majoring in Data Science. As someone who studies
                data and technology, I’m especially aware of how digital systems can shape the way people think,
                interact, and form opinions.
            </p>

            <!-- Academic Interests -->
            <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
            <p>
                I’m interested in sports and video games, and I’m also curious about how data and technology shape
                what people experience online. I pay attention to how systems can influence what gets promoted,
                recommended, or treated as “normal.”
            </p>

            <!-- Goals -->
            <h4>My Goals</h4>
            <p>
                I took this class because I want to understand how technology connects with society, and how bias
                can shape what people see as “normal” or “safe” in tech spaces.
