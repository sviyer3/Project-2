					<h4>Who I Am</h4>
                    <p>
                       Hey everyone, my name is Shrinath Iyer and I am a senior attending UW-Madison. I am currently pursuing information sciences and enjoy learning about different facets of information sciences.
                    </p>

                     <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
                     <p>
                       I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence works and it's ability to shape the future.
                     </p>

                    <h4>My Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                       I hope to learn more about intersectionality in tech and I am very excited to learn more about all of you as the semester goes on.
                    </p>

					<h4>Who I Am</h4>
                    <p>
                       Hi everyone, my name is Jassi. I am a senior studying Information Science. I was a Computer
                       Science major before, so I have some experience in coding, especially front end.
                    </p>
					<p>
					In my free time I love watching movies, playing video games, and hanging out with my cat Biscuit.
					</p>

                     <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
                     <p>
                       I’m interested in how people interact with technology and how design choices can shape what
                       users notice, trust, or misunderstand. I also like learning about front-end development and
                       building interfaces that feel clear and easy to use.
                     </p>

                    <h4>My Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                      I’m excited to take this course because it connects areas I haven’t explored much before, and I
                      want to better understand how technology and society affect each other.  
                    </p>

					<h3>Yilin Gao</h3>
					
					<h4>Who I Am</h4>
                    <p>
                       Hi everyone. My name is Yilin Gao. I’m a senior majoring in Data Science. As someone who studies
                       data and technology, I’m especially aware of how digital systems can shape the way people think,
                       interact, and form opinions.
                    </p>

                     <h4>My Academic Interests</h4>
                     <p>
                       I’m interested in sports and video games, and I’m also curious about how data and technology shape
                       what people experience online. I pay attention to how systems can influence what gets promoted,
                       recommended, or treated as “normal.”
                     </p>

                    <h4>My Goals</h4>
                    <p>
                      I took this class because I want to understand how technology connects with society, and how bias
                      can shape what people see as “normal” or “safe” in tech spaces.  
                    </p>
