    <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
    <p>
        Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding,
        actions, and decisions. These biases operate automatically and can influence behavior
        even when we consciously reject prejudice.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the IBT?</h2>
    <p>
        The Implicit Bias Test (also known as the Implicit Association Test or IAT) measures 
        automatic associations between concepts (like race or gender) and evaluations (good or bad).

    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
    <p>
        Intersectionality describes how overlapping identities (race, gender, class, sexuality)
        shape individual experiences of privilege and oppression.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters in College</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding implicit bias and intersectionality helps create inclusive classrooms,
        equitable policies, and respectful communities.
